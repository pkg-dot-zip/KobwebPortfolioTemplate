## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
This repository template contains a ready-to-go website built in Kotlin for you to use. 

### What does it do? ü§î
The project retrieves the repositories from your GitHub account url to create a simple overview site that is automatically updated. This way you don't have to add a new project to your website if you create a new repository using your GitHub account. **Deploy once, never update again.**

### Why?! üò±
I am someone that doesn't only create big projects, but also a lot of smaller ones. I don't want to have to update my website every week. Who has the time for that?

This solution simply **saves** a lot of **time**.

### Features üåü
- An automatically updated site.
- Animated video background.
- An About page that is generated from your markdown file (and you can add more pages using markdown and Kotlin!).
- A 'special date' system that lets you configure what images and text to display on the front page!
- A custom "logger" class to better handle console output.
- CSS effects on hover of images.

## üåê Example <a name = "example"></a>
You can look at a live version of a website that used this template [here](https://pkg-dot-zip.com/).

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
### Retrieving the project
#### Method 1: (**Recommended**)
1. Open the terminal in an empty directory where you want to clone this template to.
1. Open your terminal and run the following command:
```bash
kobweb create --repo https://github.com/pkg-dot-zip/KobwebPortfolioTemplate
```
Then follow the instructions in your terminal.

#### Method 2:
1. Go to the [project page on GitHub](https://github.com/pkg-dot-zip/KobwebPortfolioTemplate).
1. Click on the green button displaying the text "Use this template" and follow the instructions.
1. Clone your newly crafted repository and start working on the site.

### Getting started
1. Open the project in [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) (or navigate to project folder in cmd).
1. Open the Terminal tab at the bottom of your screen.
1. Type the following:

```bash
cd site
kobweb run
```
4. Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with your browser to see the result. This is a live view of your website; any time you make adjustments, the site will rebuild and you can view the results here.
*Note*: You can configure the port in *site/.kobweb/conf.yaml*.

### Exporting the site
1. Open up your terminal in the *site* folder again. If you are still in IntelliJ running the site, press Q in the terminal to stop it.
1. Then export the project using:

```bash
kobweb export --layout static
```

### Tips & Tricks
#### Markdown Support
Kobweb markdown support is enabled, which is used by default for the About page. This means that when you drag your markdown files into the markdown folder in your resources, it'll generate a page for each one of them. For a better explanation check [here](https://github.com/varabyte/kobweb?tab=readme-ov-file#markdown).

#### Chrome Extensions
If you want to create your own pages, or change the layout, these Chrome Extensions are recommended to speed up development.

I found out about Kobweb due to [this LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7150703760011366400?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), in which Binay Shaw showcased his [Kotfolio](https://github.com/binayshaw7777/Kotfolio) project. So special thanks to him. üòÅ 

And lastly thanks to the entire Kobweb community, whom assisted me by taking their time to answer my questions in their [Discord server](https://discord.gg/9F4Q6r42j2). üôè
